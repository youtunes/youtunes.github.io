          <h2>How was this made?</h2>
          <p>
            Youtunes is a pet project of mine. I use Youtube to listen to music a lot and wanted a much better interface than
            the youtube webpage. Also, it gave me a chance to play learn ReactJS and Electron, two tools used to write Youtunes.

      <h2>Is it free?</h2>
      <p>
        Yup! As I said, it's just something I play with in my free time, and so it's completely free! If you want some way to repay me,
        just spread the word and tell your friends.
